# Data-Acquisition-Processing-and-Wireless-Transmission-Subsystem-for-the-Red-winged-Starling-Project

Welcome to the Data Acquisition, Processing, and Wireless Transmission Subsystem for the Red-winged Starling Project! This project is an integral part of a larger research initiative aimed at studying the Red-winged Starling. This subsystem is responsible for accurately processing and analyzing weight measurements and identification data, ensuring seamless wireless transmission to a local machine for further analysis.

## Project Overview
The Data Acquisition, Processing, and Wireless Transmission Subsystem is designed to handle data from sensors that measure the weight of Red-winged Starlings. The subsystem ensures accurate weight calibration, associates weight data with corresponding bird images, and transmits this processed information wirelessly to a local machine for further analysis and storage.

## Features
Accurate Weight Calibration: Ensures precise weight measurements.
Data Association: Links weight data with bird images for comprehensive analysis.
Wireless Transmission: Seamlessly transmits processed data to a local machine.
Real-time Monitoring: Allows for immediate data access and analysis.
